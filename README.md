Fresh and amazing

My name is Cinged and I love fish. I started learning to code by making a website about my fish, which is really behind on the actual work that I've been doing on my tanks. 
I have 3 fish tanks, and I am so excited to be having snail BABIES!! Most people cringe at the thought of snails in their fish tanks, but I aspire to have a puffer fish, so I need the snails to provide my future puffer.
